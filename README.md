# ASD-Internship-assessments
I have completed an internship focused on Python programming under the ASD training initiative. This helps me to gain practical experience in Python concepts, including data types, control structures, functions, file handling, and basic libraries. Worked on small projects to strengthen logical thinking and problem-solving skills in structured way.
